    <h1>Support</h1>
    <p>
      All projects are maintained in the
      <a href="https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org" rel="noopener">mcp-tool-shop-org</a>
      GitHub organization. Issues are the primary support channel.
    </p>

    <h2>Filing an issue</h2>
    <p>
      Open an issue on the relevant repo. Include the following so we can help faster:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What you expected</strong> to happen.</li>
      <li><strong>What actually happened</strong>, including any error messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Steps to reproduce</strong> the problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> OS, runtime version (Python/Node/.NET), and tool version.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Feature requests</h2>
    <p>
      Open an issue with the <code>enhancement</code> label. Describe the use case, not just the solution.
      Knowing <em>why</em> you need something helps us design the right thing.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      If you find a security vulnerability, <strong>do not open a public issue</strong>.
      Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on the affected repo.
    </p>

    <h2>General questions</h2>
    <p>
      For questions that don't fit into an issue, open a
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/mcp-tool-shop-org/discussions" rel="noopener">Discussion</a>
      in the org.
