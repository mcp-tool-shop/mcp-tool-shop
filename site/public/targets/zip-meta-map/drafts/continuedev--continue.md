Partnership: zip-meta-map + continue

## Body

[context] Hi — we built zip-meta-map and noticed continuedev/continue.

Make repos and ZIPs self-describing for LLMs with CI-grade diffs.

**Proven capabilities:**

- Given the same repository state, zip-meta-map produces byte-identical index output. (proof: https://mcptoolshop.com/press/zip-meta-map/)
- The test suite contains 246 passing tests covering CLI, schema validation, and diff behavior. (proof: https://mcptoolshop.com/press/zip-meta-map/)
- zip-meta-map diff --exit-code returns non-zero when metadata drifts, suitable for CI gating. (proof: https://mcptoolshop.com/press/zip-meta-map/)

**What we offer:**

- **integration:** We will work with LLM tool authors to integrate zip-meta-map indexes as a context source.
- **early-access:** Pre-release access to new index formats and plan structures before public release.
