# Example Outputs

Real artifacts generated by `promo-kit` during the W07 2026 weekly dogfood run.

| File | What it proves |
|------|---------------|
| [trust-receipt.json](trust-receipt.json) | SHA-256 hashes of 8 artifacts, tied to commit `43fa469`, 5 proven claims |
| [decision-drift.json](decision-drift.json) | Week-over-week change report (zero drift = stable baseline) |
| [recommendations.json](recommendations.json) | Advisory recommendations with guardrail caps enforced |

These are zero-state outputs (no tools promoted yet). In a live catalog, the arrays populate with entrants, exits, score deltas, and actionable recommendations.

**Verification**: All 8 SHA-256 hashes in `trust-receipt.json` were cross-checked against `sha256sum` on the source files. Generators were run twice to confirm deterministic output.
