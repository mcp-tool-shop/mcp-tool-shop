**Building the tools that AI agents use to get real work done.**

</div>

---

I build MCP servers, desktop apps, and AI infrastructure under **[mcp-tool-shop-org](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org)** — 99 public repositories spanning semantic search, code analysis, voice synthesis, accessibility tooling, and Windows desktop apps.

### What I'm Working On

- **[File Compass](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/file-compass)** — Semantic file search with HNSW indexing and local Ollama embeddings. Multi-language AST chunking, <100ms queries over 10K+ files.
- **[Tool Compass](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/tool-compass)** — Find MCP tools by describing what you need. 115+ indexed tools, progressive disclosure pattern.
- **[Soundboard Plugin](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/soundboard-plugin)** — Give Claude Code a voice. 12 voices, emotion-aware speech, multi-speaker dialogue.
- **[Brain-Dev](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/brain-dev)** — MCP server for code analysis: test generation, security audits, health scoring.
- **[Comfy-Headless](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/comfy-headless)** — Headless ComfyUI with prompt intelligence and video generation.

### Stack

```
Python · TypeScript · C# · .NET MAUI · WinUI 3
MCP · FastMCP · Ollama · HNSW · CUDA
Windows-first · RTX 5080 · Local-only
```

### Philosophy

Everything runs locally. No cloud dependencies for core functionality. Tools compose through the Model Context Protocol. Append-only where it matters. Accessibility baked in, not bolted on.

*Syntropy above all else.*
